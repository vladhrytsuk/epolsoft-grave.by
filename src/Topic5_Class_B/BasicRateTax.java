/*Create a BasicRateTax class with a method calcTax() that returns 20% of a fixed base income of 1000$. 
 * Add mew calcTax() method to BasicRateTax xlass that takes a double grossIncome parameter and calculates the 
 * tax as 20% of the grossIncome if it's greater than the base income of 1000$. Create a test java program named 
 * TaxCollector that creates a new BasicRateTax object, calls both calcTax() methods and prints the output to console.*/
