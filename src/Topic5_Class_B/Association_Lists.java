/*Final project: Association Lists
One particularly common application of searching is with association lists. The standard example of an association list is a dictionary. 
A dictionary associates definitions with words. Given a word, you can use the dictionary to look up its definition. We can think of the 
dictionary as being a list of pairs of the form (w,d), where w is a word and d is its definition. 
A general association list is a list of pairs (k,v), where k is some “key” value, and v is a value associated to that key. 
In general, we want to assume that no two pairs in the list have the same key. 
There are two basic operations on association lists: Given a key, k, find the value v associated with k, if any. And given a key, k, 
and a value v, add the pair (k,v) to the association list (replacing the pair, if any, that had the same key value). 
The two operations are usually called get and put .

A PhoneDirectory holds a list of names with a phone number for each name. It is possible to find the number associated with a given name, 
and to specify the phone number for a given name.*/
