/*Deck of cards (Enum)
Write a class whose instances represent a single playing card from a deck of cards. Playing cards have two distinguishing properties: 
rank and suit. Be sure to use Enum Types to represent the proporties.
Write a class whose instances represents a full deck of cards. You should also keep this solution.
Write a small program to test your deck and card classes. The program can be as simple as creating a deck of cards and displaying its cards.*/
